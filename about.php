                             <p>Founder Tom Byng went to the USA & came back with a mission. Together with Head Chef Fred Smith, they created a signature range of indulgent and super satisfying burgers, driven by the belief that nothing beats a big juicy burger. With that, Byron was born in 2007 around the UK, transforming the British burger scene beyond recognition. Everyone wants to know where their meal is coming from. As you should. We pride in cracking top-quality ingredients and forming humble relationships with our supply chain. And so here it is:</p>

                            <p>We like to be contrary to the 'norm', because we want to stand out, and set the trends for the wider burger world. Bigger, better, bolder... every restaurant looks different, every experience feels fresh, but every burger remains consistently tasty. If we're slightly out of reach, fear not, our burgers on bikes are spreading across the country and you'll likely find us on Deliveroo near you. Whether you get your Byron fix at home or in our fun filled restaurants, we're sure you'll be licking your lips and coming back for more.</p>
